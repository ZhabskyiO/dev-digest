# Insights — `server`

Append-only log of things learned the hard way in this package: gotchas, dead
ends, and *why* a workaround exists. Newest at the top.

> **Format:** new entries go under the matching section below as
> `- YYYY-MM-DD — one-line claim`, with `file:line` evidence where it applies.
> Lead hard constraints with **NEVER** / **ALWAYS**.
> **Corrections:** append `└ YYYY-MM-DD correction: …` beneath an entry — never
> rewrite, move, or delete what is already there.
> When an entry starts causing repeated mistakes, promote a one-line version of
> it into [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and leave the full detail here.
> Repo-wide entries belong in [../insights.md](../insights.md) instead.

## 2026-07-28 — server tsc/tests fail on reviewer-core's deps, not server's

**Symptom:** `pnpm install` in `server/` succeeds, but `pnpm typecheck` fails
with `TS2307: Cannot find module '@devdigest/reviewer-core'` (cascading into
`unknown` → `T` errors), or `pnpm test` crashes at module load with
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `openai`/`zod` — packages `server/package.json`
doesn't even list.

**Cause:** `tsconfig.json` aliases `@devdigest/reviewer-core` →
`../reviewer-core/src/index.ts`, so the server type-checks and runs
reviewer-core's **raw TypeScript source**, not a built package. That source's
own imports (`openai`, `zod`) resolve from `reviewer-core/node_modules` — a
directory `server`'s own `pnpm install` never touches.

**Fix:** `cd ../reviewer-core && pnpm install` (or `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
in CI) as a separate step before typechecking or testing `server/`. Every CI
workflow that touches server (`server-unit.yml`, `server-integration.yml`,
`e2e-web.yml`) already does this as an explicit "Install reviewer-core deps"
step — mirror it locally after a clean clone or after deleting
`reviewer-core/node_modules`.
